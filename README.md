# Automated_CSV_Data_Analysis
This project provides a robust, standardized pipeline for data extraction, processing, analyzing, and modeling. The user only needs to hand off the fileâ€™s pathname for the program to conduct parameterization and execute the analysis of data and generation of modeling scripts, stored at the same directory level as the original passed in file.
